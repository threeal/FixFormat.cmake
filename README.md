**FixFormat.cmake** is a [CMake](https://cmake.org/) module that provides utility functions for fixing source code formatting during your project's build process.
This module primarily includes a [`target_fix_format`](./cmake/FixFormat.cmake) function designed to fix the source code formatting required by the target before the compilation step.

Behind the scenes, this module utilizes [ClangFormat](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) to format the source codes.
To enable the formatting to be fixed before the compilation step, the module searches through all source files used by the target and creates a format target that the main target later depends on.

## Requirements

- CMake version 3.21 or above.
- ClangFormat.

## Integration

### Including the Script File

You can integrate this module into your project by including the [FixFormat.cmake](./cmake/FixFormat.cmake) file in your project.

```cmake
include(FixFormat)
```

### Using CPM.cmake

Alternatively, you can use [CPM.cmake](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake) to seamlessly integrate this module into your project.

```cmake
cpmaddpackage(gh:threeal/FixFormat.cmake@1.0.0)
include(FixFormat)
```

## Usage

### Fixing Formatting on a Target

To fix the source codes formatting required by a target, use the `target_fix_format` function. This function will automatically fix the formatting right before the compilation step of the target.

```cmake
add_executable(main main.cpp)
target_include_directories(main PRIVATE include)

target_fix_format(main)
```

### Configuring the Formatting Style

Similar to ClangFormat, you can configure the formatting style by including a `.clang-format` file.
Refer to [this documentation](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html) for more information on configuring the formatting style.
